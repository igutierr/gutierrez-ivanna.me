          <p>My dream since elementary school has been to work with computers. Currently I am an 

undergraduate student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, majoring in Software 

Information Systems with a concentration in Web Development and a minor in Mathematics. 

I have worked at the Game+Learning lab at UNC Charlotte creating games that teach 

computer science concepts to children. I also volunteers at the Microsoft Digigirlz Summer 

Program. There I help young girls learn more about technology and career possibilities in 

these fields. In 2013 and 2014 I coordinated summer camps for middle school girls called 

"Girls & Tech" from the Aspire IT NCWIT grant. These camps focused on using Kodu, CS 

Unplugged, and Khan Academy to teach computer science concepts. I expect to continue 

coordinating these summer camps in coming years. During the summer of 2013 and 2014 I 

also interned at Bank of America as a Global Market Risk Technology and Operations 

(GMRT&O) Developer intern. I also like to help teach children how to read and write in 

Spanish using bible stories.</p>

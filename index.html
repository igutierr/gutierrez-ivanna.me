          <p>Ivanna's dream since elementary school has been to work with computers. Currently she is an 

undergraduate student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, majoring in Software 

Information Systems with a concentration in Web Development and a minor in Mathematics. 

She has worked at the Game+Learning lab at UNC Charlotte creating games that teach 

computer science concepts to children. She also volunteers at the Microsoft Digigirlz Summer 

Program. There she helps young girls learn more about technology and career possibilities in 

these fields. In 2013 and 2014 she coordinated summer camps for middle school girls called 

"Girls & Tech" from the Aspire IT NCWIT grant. These camps focused on using Kodu, CS 

Unplugged, and Khan Academy to teach computer science concepts. She expects to continue 

coordinating these summer camps in coming years. During the summer of 2013 and 2014 she 

also interned at Bank of America as a Global Market Risk Technology and Operations 

(GMRT&O) Developer intern. She also likes to help teach children how to read and write in 

Spanish using bible stories.</p>
